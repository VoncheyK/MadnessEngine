       its distributors in the country where it was collected, and possibly in
       the United States and Germany.  United States laws regarding processing

       jurisdiction.

7. Miscellaneous.

  7.1. Governing Law; Jurisdiction and Venue.
       This Agreement shall be governed by and construed and enforced in
       accordance with the laws of the Commonwealth of Virginia without

       permitted by law, the provisions of this Agreement shall supersede any
       provisions of the Uniform Commercial Code as adopted or made applicable
       to the Products in any competent jurisdiction.  This Agreement shall
       not be governed by the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the
       International Sale of Goods, the application of which is expressly
       disclaimed and excluded.  The federal and state courts within the
       Commonwealth of Virginia shall have exclusive jurisdiction to
       adjudicate any dispute arising out of this Agreement. You agree that
       this Agreement is to be performed in Commonwealth of Virginia and that
       any action, dispute, controversy, or claim that may be instituted based
       on this Agreement, or arising out of or related to this Agreement or
       any alleged breach thereof, shall be prosecuted exclusively in the
       federal or state courts in the Commonwealth of Virginia, and you, to
       the extent permitted by applicable law, hereby waive the right to
       change venue to any other state, county, district or jurisdiction;
       provided, however, that the Company as claimant shall be entitled to
       initiate proceedings in any court of competent jurisdiction.

  7.2. Period for Bringing Actions.
       No action, regardless of form, arising out of the transactions under
       this Agreement, may be brought by either party hereto more than
       one (1) year after the cause of action has occurred, or was discovered
       to have occurred, except that an action for infringement of
       intellectual property rights may be brought within the maximum
       applicable statutory period.

  7.3. Entire Agreement; Severability; No Waiver.
       This Agreement is the entire agreement between you and Company and
       supersedes any other prior agreements, proposals, communications or
       advertising, oral or written, with respect to the Product or to subject
       matter of this Agreement provided that the Company and you may limit,
       modify or changes the applicability of the terms of this Agreement by
       a prior, contemporaneous or subsequent written agreement by referencing
       this Section 7.3 of the Agreement and expressly providing for such
       limitation, modification or changes. You acknowledge that you have read
       this Agreement, understand it and agree to be bound by its terms. If
       any provision of this Agreement is found by a court of competent
       jurisdiction to be invalid, void, or unenforceable for any reason, in
       whole or in part, such provision will be more narrowly construed so
       that it becomes legal and enforceable, and the entire Agreement will
       not fail on account thereof and the balance of the Agreement will
       continue in full force and effect to the fullest extent permitted by
       law. No waiver of any breach of any provisions of this Agreement will
       constitute a waiver of any prior, concurrent or subsequent breach and
       no waiver will be effective unless made in writing.
